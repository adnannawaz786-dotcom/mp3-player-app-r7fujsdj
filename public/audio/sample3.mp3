I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To complete your project, you'll need to:

1. Find or create actual MP3 audio files
2. Place them in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name them `sample1.mp3`, `sample2.mp3`, `sample3.mp3`, etc.

You can:
- Use royalty-free music from sites like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Convert existing audio files to MP3 format
- Use sample tracks from music libraries
- Create your own audio recordings

The MP3 files should be actual audio files, not text files, so they need to be obtained from audio sources and copied into your project directory.
