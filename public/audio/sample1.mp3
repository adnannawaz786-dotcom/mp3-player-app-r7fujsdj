I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file in your project, you would need to:

1. Obtain an actual MP3 audio file (either record one, download from a royalty-free source, or use a sample track)
2. Place the MP3 file in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample1.mp3`

The file would then be accessible in your Next.js application at the URL path `/audio/sample1.mp3`.

For development purposes, you could use any short MP3 file as a placeholder, or find royalty-free samples from sources like:
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com
- Adobe Stock Audio
- YouTube Audio Library

The MP3 file should be a standard format (typically 44.1kHz, stereo) for best compatibility with web audio APIs.
