I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file in your project, you would need to:

1. Obtain an actual MP3 audio file (either record one, download from a royalty-free source, or convert from another format)
2. Place the MP3 file in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample2.mp3`

The file would then be accessible in your Next.js application at the URL `/audio/sample2.mp3` and could be used with HTML5 audio elements or audio libraries.

For development purposes, you could use any short MP3 file as a placeholder, or find royalty-free music from sources like:
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com
- YouTube Audio Library
- Pixabay Music
